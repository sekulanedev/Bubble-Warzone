      <h2 id="who-we-are">1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Bubble Warzone (“the Game”) handles information when you use it.
        “We”, “us”, and “our” refer to the developer/publisher of the Game.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Developer/Publisher:</strong> Brighton Sekulane<br/>
        <strong>Support email:</strong> <em>bk.sekulane.dev@gmail.com</em>
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-we-collect">2. Data we collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Account and profile information (if you sign in)</h3>
      <p>
        The Game supports sign‑in methods such as Google Sign‑In, Google Play Games, and Email/Password (on supported builds).
        If you create or sign in to an account, we (and our service providers) may process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase user ID</strong> (a unique identifier used to link your account and save progress).</li>
        <li><strong>Display name / username</strong> you choose for leaderboards and in‑game identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Age</strong> (entered by you) used to determine eligibility for certain features (for example, leaderboards).</li>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> (only if you use email sign‑in or your provider shares it). We do not store your raw email in our Firestore profile records; authentication providers may retain it for account management.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication provider</strong> (e.g., Google, Play Games, email) for account support and security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Gameplay and progress data</h3>
      <p>
        We store gameplay progress to operate the game economy and features. This can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scores</strong> (including personal best score and timestamps).</li>
        <li><strong>Tokens, pins, and continues/extra lives</strong> (your in‑game balances and changes).</li>
        <li><strong>Daily reward and streak state</strong> (to prevent repeating rewards incorrectly).</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboard entries</strong> (your username and best score, where eligible).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Device and app information (technical)</h3>
      <p>
        Like most apps, the Game and its service providers may process limited technical data needed to run the app and keep it secure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device information</strong> (e.g., OS version, device model, language, app version).</li>
        <li><strong>Log and diagnostic information</strong> (e.g., error messages, performance events) to help us troubleshoot and improve stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Network information</strong> (e.g., IP address) used for security, fraud prevention, and service operation. IP can sometimes be used to infer approximate location.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        If you allow notifications, the Game uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver:
        daily reminders, announcements, and other gameplay notifications.
        This may involve a <strong>device messaging token</strong> associated with your device/app instance.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 In‑app purchases</h3>
      <p>
        The Game may offer optional in‑app purchases (for example, token packs). Purchases are processed by Google Play.
        We do <strong>not</strong> receive your full payment card details. We may receive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purchase product ID</strong> (which item was bought).</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase status</strong> (successful/failed/restored) and a transaction/purchase token from Google Play to validate and deliver your items.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.6 Advertising (free version)</h3>
      <p>
        The free version may display ads using Google AdMob. Ad providers may collect and use data to
        provide, measure, and improve ads, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong> (or other device identifiers where permitted).</li>
        <li><strong>Ad interaction data</strong> (impressions, clicks, reward completion).</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (inferred from IP, where applicable) and other contextual signals for ad delivery and fraud prevention.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you buy the paid version, ads may be removed. If you use features that rely on third‑party services (e.g., sign‑in, cloud sync),
        those services may still process data as described above.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-we-use">3. How we use data</h2>
      <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core gameplay features (play sessions, scoring, levels, obstacle worlds).</li>
        <li>Save and sync your progress (tokens, personal best, profile) across sessions/devices (where supported).</li>
        <li>Operate leaderboards and prevent misuse (where supported and age-eligible).</li>
        <li>Deliver optional in‑app purchases and restore purchases where applicable.</li>
        <li>Show ads in the free version and deliver rewarded ad benefits when you choose to watch an ad.</li>
        <li>Send notifications you enable (daily reminders and announcements).</li>
        <li>Maintain security, troubleshoot issues, and improve app performance and reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="sharing">4. Sharing and third parties</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We share information only as needed to run the Game:
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Service providers</h3>
      <p>
        We use third‑party services that process data on our behalf:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore database, Cloud Messaging) to support sign‑in, saving progress, leaderboards, and notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads in the free version (and to provide rewarded ads when you opt in to watch them).</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play</strong> (Billing) to process purchases and subscriptions (if offered) and to validate transactions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Legal and safety</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law,
        enforce our terms, protect users, prevent fraud, or respond to lawful requests.
      </p>

      <h2 id="choices">5. Your choices and controls</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        You can enable/disable notifications in your device settings at any time. Some reminders may also be toggled inside the Game settings.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Personalized ads</h3>
      <p>
        Where applicable, you can manage ad personalization through your Google settings (for example, reset or limit the Advertising ID,
        or adjust ad personalization controls). The options available depend on your device and region.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Access, correction, and deletion</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Delete your account in-app:</strong> The Game includes an in‑app “Delete Account” option which, when confirmed,
        deletes your account and associated cloud data (such as profile, leaderboard entry, and synced progress), and clears local data on the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have trouble deleting your account in-app, you can contact us at the support email listed in the
        <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section to request deletion.
      </p>

      <h2 id="retention">6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your account and cloud data for as long as your account remains active and you use the Game,
        unless a longer retention period is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (for example, fraud prevention).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can request deletion at any time using the in‑app deletion option. After deletion, some information may persist in backups for a limited period
        or in aggregated/anonymous form that can’t reasonably be used to identify you.
      </p>

      <h2 id="security">7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. Data transmitted to our service providers
        is typically protected using encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="international">8. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The Game uses Google services (Firebase, AdMob, Google Play) which may process data on servers located in various countries.
        By using the Game, you understand that information may be processed outside your country of residence, subject to applicable legal safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2 id="children">9. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Bubble Warzone is a general‑audience game and may be used by both adults and children.
        We take children’s privacy seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not knowingly collect</strong> personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe a child has provided
        personal information to us, please contact us and we will work to delete that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some online or account‑based features may be <strong>restricted or unavailable</strong> depending on the age the player provides and local requirements.
        For example, features such as public leaderboards, cloud‑sync, or certain notifications may be limited for younger users.
      </p>

      <h2 id="changes">10. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above and, when appropriate,
        provide additional notice within the Game.
      </p>
